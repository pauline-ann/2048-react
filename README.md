## A [React clone] of the [original 2048 game] by Gabriele Cirulli.

I played this game a lot when it first came out and I had a lot of fun recreating it!

## How to Play
- 2048 is a game in which you merge like tiles together until 2048 is reached.
- 2 and 2 combine to make 4, 4 and 4 combine to make 8, etc.
- If you run out of moves (the board is full and no tiles can be combined), it's game over.
- On desktop, press the arrow keys or the WASD keys to move the tiles in the direction that is pressed.
- On touch screen devices, the same may be achieved with swipe gestures.

## Tech

2048 React uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - Front-end JavaScript library
- [Node.js] - JavaScript runtime environment
- [Vite] - development environment alternative to `create-react-app` (had a smooth experience using this one!)
- [Sass] - CSS, but fancier
- [react-swipeable] - npm package that makes capturing touch screen swipe motions a breeze

## Installation

2048 React requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.
